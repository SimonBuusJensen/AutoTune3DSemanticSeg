# Automatic Hyperparmeter Tuning for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds
This repository contains code for automatically finding appropriate hyper-parameters for 3D semantic segmentation of 3D Point Clouds.

Dataset specific Hyperparameters:
- Voxel size (for voxel downsampling)
- Query ball radius (for locating neighbouring points)
